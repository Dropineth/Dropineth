A decentralized lottery platform employing DePIN to tokenize real-world assets related to reforestation, allowing participants to directly contribute to the UN FAO's Great Green Wall initiative while earning rewards.


# Project Overview
Dropin is an innovative blockchain DApp built on the Vara Network and Solana, designed to provide users with a new interactive experience and value creation platform through gamified lotteries, financial incentives, NFT assets, and decentralized trading. Leveraging smart contracts and blockchain technology, Dropin ensures fairness, transparency, and security in the DroPin lottery process.

## Core Features

Note: The core features represent the first four steps of the implemented roadmap.

### Core Feature 1: User Registration and Authentication
**Explanation:**
Users can register via email or social accounts, complete KYC verification, or link their wallet address for identity validation.

###  Feature 2: Equipment Crowdfunding
**Explanation:**
Users can participate in crowdfunding as a group to purchase solar panels, drip irrigation pipes, and other equipment to achieve sustainable development goals.

###  Feature 3: Lucky Draw
**Explanation:**
At the end of each crowdfunding cycle, the system randomly selects lucky users to gain corresponding DePIN rights, including future benefits from power, water, and pipeline supply. Non-winning users will receive tree planting rights and can benefit from future carbon credits. If a winning user opts out of DePIN rights, they can choose to participate in the GameFi lottery to receive tokens.

###  Feature 4: Blink Sharing on Twitter
**Explanation:**
Users can share activities via Blink to Twitter, and through sharing interactions, they can earn rewards, such as optional tree planting rights.

###  Feature 5: NFT Trading: Roadmap
**Explanation:**
Users can trade NFTs on decentralized exchanges, enabling asset circulation.

###  Feature 6: Exploring DAO Governance Model: Roadmap
**Explanation:**
Establish a decentralized autonomous organization to allow community members to participate in project decision-making.

# V1.0

# Vara-Dropin DApp

A Decentralized Lottery Protocol Harnessing DeFi, GameFi, and Novel Blockchain Paradigms


## Main Track

### Innovative Dapps
This track focuses on innovative applications such as DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, DEXs, and other applications that drive mass adoption.

## Bounty 
### Vara Network Track
### Bifrost

# Project Overview
Dropin is an innovative blockchain DApp built on the Vara Network, designed to provide users with a new interactive experience and value creation platform through gamified lotteries, financial incentives, NFT assets, and decentralized trading. Leveraging smart contracts and blockchain technology, Dropin ensures fairness, transparency, and security in the lottery process.

## Core Features

Note: The core features represent the first two steps of the implemented roadmap.

### Core Feature 1: DeFi (Staking Rewards Lottery)

**Explanation:**
- Users can participate in lottery activities by staking VARA tokens. The staking process generates rewards based on DeFi principles.
- Staking rewards are converted into lottery tickets, allowing users to participate in the lottery without additional costs.
- The staked VARA tokens continue to generate rewards during the lock-up period, which can be used to cover lottery costs or reinvested.

### Core Feature 2: Gaming (Gamified Lottery)

**Explanation:**
- Users send an amount of VARA tokens equivalent to 0.1 ETH to the smart contract to participate in the lottery.
- Once the lottery pool reaches a predetermined amount (e.g., 1 ETH worth of VARA), the smart contract randomly selects a lucky user.
- The winning user receives VARA tokens equivalent to 0.9 ETH, while the DApp operator collects VARA tokens equivalent to 0.1 ETH as gas fees and operational costs.

### Core Feature 3: Telegram Sharing (Social Media Growth)

**Explanation:**
- Users can promote Dropin DApp by sharing information or activities via Telegram to increase social media growth and engagement.
- Sharing activities may include inviting new users, sharing lottery results, or participating in community discussions.
- As an incentive, sharers may receive additional lottery tickets or small VARA token rewards to encourage DApp promotion.
- Incentives will be distributed based on 10% of the gas fees collected in each lottery round, proportionally allocated to participating promotional addresses.

### Core Feature 4: GameFi (Gamified Finance)

**Explanation:**
- Even if users do not win the lottery, they still have a chance to earn rewards through the GameFi mechanism.
- Based on their on-chain interaction history, such as staking, sharing, and participation, users will receive airdrops of tokens from collaborating Web3 projects.
- Airdropped tokens may be VARA or other tokens circulating on the Vara Network, provided by projects partnering with Dropin.

## Roadmap

### Roadmap 1: Gaming (Gamified Lottery)

**Description:**
- Users participate in a blockchain-based fair lottery by sending 0.01 ETH to the smart contract to join the lottery pool. Once the pool reaches 1 ETH, the smart contract randomly selects a winning address from 100 participants. The winning address receives 0.9 ETH, and the DApp operator collects 0.1 ETH as gas fees and operational costs.

**Example:**
- At the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) launch, suppose 100 on-chain addresses participate, each contributing 0.01 ETH to form a total prize pool of 1 ETH. A single address is selected through the smart contract’s random selection mechanism to receive a 0.9 ETH reward.

### Roadmap 2: GameFi (Gamified Finance)

**Description:**
- Non-winning participants receive token airdrops from collaborating Web3 projects based on their on-chain interaction history. This mechanism rewards user participation and loyalty while providing potential new users and community members to partnering projects. Dropin earns operational income through service fees or tokens from the airdrop projects.

**Example:**
- Among the 100 addresses mentioned above, those not receiving the 0.9 ETH reward will receive token airdrops based on their on-chain activities. The airdrop ratio and amount are automatically calculated by the smart contract based on preset algorithms and user interaction data.

### Roadmap 3: NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)

**Description:**
- To reduce the negative impact of zero-sum games, NFTs are introduced as part of the rewards to increase the appeal of lottery activities. The ETH contributed by users is split into N fractional NFTs, each representing a certain value of ETH. The smart contract randomly selects one address out of 100, which receives an NFT worth 90u, while the operator's address collects 10u as gas and operational fees.

**Example:**
- Suppose a 1 ETH asset is split into 1,000 1u ETH fractional NFTs. Users participate in the lottery by contributing 1u, forming a 100u prize pool. The winner receives an NFT worth 90u, and the operator collects 10u.

### Roadmap 4: DEX (Decentralized Exchange)

**Description:**
- Users are allowed to freely trade NFTs on a decentralized exchange, realizing the market value of NFTs. NFTs can be exchanged 1:1 for ETH on the DEX, ensuring their liquidity and utility. Through the DEX, users can buy and sell NFTs, including those won in the lottery or purchased on the DEX.

**Example:**
- A user lists their NFT for sale on the DEX, priced based on the NFT’s current market value. Other users can purchase these NFTs, with transactions automatically executed through smart contracts, ensuring security and transparency.

## Project Advantages
- **Vara Network Integration:** Fully utilizes the high performance and security of Vara Network to provide a seamless user experience.
- **Innovative Lottery Mechanism:** Combines DeFi and GameFi elements to offer an attractive lottery model, enhancing user engagement.
- **NFT Asset Liquidity:** Enhances NFT liquidity through the DEX, allowing users to trade and invest in NFT assets.
- **Community-Driven:** Encourages community participation and governance, jointly driving project development.

# Conclusion
By combining the features of the Vara Network, Dropin DApp provides an innovative blockchain lottery platform that not only increases user interaction and engagement but also creates new value opportunities through the integration of DeFi and NFTs. As the project continues to develop and the community grows, Dropin is poised to become a shining star in the Vara Network ecosystem.
